Project build guide

1. Requirements
  * Windows 10
    * Visual Studio 2019.
	* Python 3.5 or later
	* CMake 3.15+
  * Linux
    * Mint 16 and Mint 17 were tested.
	* GCC 8 or later.
	* Python 3.5 or later
	* CMake 3.15 or later
	
2. Build steps
  * Run build_all.py which is located at root of project.
  * If it is the first run of build_all.py, an configuration file "proj.py" will be generated.
  * Edit proj.py after read the comments of the file.
  * If build tool is visual studio, vs solution file will be generated in sub folder of 'build'.
 
3. REMARK
  * Each configuration was built once build_all.py was run. But visual studio supports multiple configurations in one project. You should modify proj.py and execute build_all.py for each of configurations.
